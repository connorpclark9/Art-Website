        <h1>Our Philosophy</h1>
        <p class="about-hero__subtitle">Art is more than decoration. It is a conversation between the person who made it and the person who lives with it. We exist to make that conversation possible.</p>
      </div>

    <!-- Our Story -->
    <section class="about-story section">
      <div class="container">
        <div class="prose">
          <p>Kindred Seal was born from a simple observation: the most meaningful art often comes from artists you have never heard of, working in studios and spare rooms in your own community. These artists pour everything they have into their craft, yet the distance between their work and the people who would treasure it most can feel insurmountable.</p>
          <p>The traditional gallery model does not always serve these artists well. High overhead costs, rigid exhibition schedules, and a focus on established names can leave emerging and mid-career local artists without a platform. Meanwhile, buyers who want something more personal than mass-produced prints often have no idea where to begin looking.</p>
          <p>We started Kindred Seal to bridge that gap. As a curated art broker, we do the work of finding extraordinary local talent, learning their stories, and presenting their work in a way that lets you understand not just what you are looking at, but why it matters. We handle the storytelling, the photography, and the connection so that artists can stay focused on making great work.</p>
          <p>Every artist we represent has been hand-selected. We do not list everyone who applies. Instead, we look for artists whose work shows genuine skill, whose practice reflects real commitment, and whose story adds depth and meaning to every piece they create. When you discover an artist through Kindred Seal, you can trust that what you are seeing is the real thing.</p>

          <div class="about-philosophy__card">
            <h3>Stories Matter</h3>
            <p>A piece of art becomes something entirely different when you know the hands that made it, the intention behind it, and the journey it represents. We believe context transforms decoration into connection.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="about-philosophy__card">
            <h3>Human Creativity is Irreplaceable</h3>
            <p>In an age of algorithms and automation, the work of a human hand carries more weight than ever. We champion art made by real people with real perspectives, not generated by machines.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="about-philosophy__card">
            <h3>Artists Deserve Support</h3>
            <p>Creating art is demanding work that deserves fair compensation and genuine advocacy. We exist to remove barriers between talented artists and the people who value what they do.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="about-philosophy__card">
            <h3>Local Communities Thrive Through Art</h3>
            <p>When you buy from a local artist, you invest in your community. You support a neighbor, sustain a creative practice, and bring home something with a story rooted in the place you live.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="about-curation__content prose">
          <p>Not every artist who applies to Kindred Seal is accepted. Our curation process is intentionally selective because we believe the value of what we offer depends on the quality and integrity of every artist in our roster.</p>
          <p>We evaluate artists on the strength of their craft, the consistency of their body of work, the depth of their artistic voice, and the story they bring to their practice. Technical skill matters, but so does authenticity. We look for artists who are genuinely invested in their work, who have something meaningful to communicate, and who approach their art with both discipline and heart.</p>
          <p>Once accepted, we work closely with each artist to develop their profile, photograph their work, and tell their story in a way that honors their vision. This collaborative process ensures that every artist page on Kindred Seal feels true to who they are.</p>
